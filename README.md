=======

Send an SMS and redirect messages from a number to another automatically.

Works just like call redirection, but with SMS.
You just need to create a filter for every time you receive
an SMS from any number, or all ones, or using a word pattern,  the program will automaticaly redirect the message to all other numbers that you saved.
